/*
    Manages audio buffer allocation, scheduling, and playback. Provides two main operations - play() and seekToTime(). Works in conjunction with a playerNode to perform playback.

    A "playback session" begins when playback is started, as a result of either play() or seekToTime(). It ends when either playback is completed or a new request is received (and stop() is called).
